# VectorHelper
A Python module for handling vectors calculations.

## Features
* Processes vectors as tuples.
* Supports n-dimensional calculation.
* Supports addition/subtraction, dot product and module, parallel and vertical judgment, cross product (3-dimension only).

## Notes
vec.py is the legacy version that supports up to 3D vectors. For richer features please import vecnd.py.
For the reason that in the space higher than 3-dimension, the defination of cross product may not work as expected and tend to be really puzzling, the cross product calculation function refuses to receive vectors higher than 3-dimensional.
